The goal of this project was to examine whether the is a discrepency between thesalary of male and female professors in Ontario in the 2014 fiscal year. Additonally, I examined the proportions of professors by rank (i.e., assistant professor, associate professor, professor) that are female.

In Ontario, any public employee who's annual salary exceeds $100000 is reported in a public salary disclosure. The salary disclosure contains the employer, the first and last name of the empyloyee, the position, the value of the salary, and value of the taxable benefits. Most univesities indicate whether the position is assistant professor, associate professor, or professor.

I webscraped the data from the public salary disclosure lists of universities 
for the 2014 Fiscal Year, and tranformed it into the necessary formats for 
futher analyses.

The sex of the employes is not given in the public salary disclosure. To 
determine the sex of the employee I used NamSor Gender API 
(http://namesorts.com/api/) which returns a probability of whether the name is 
male or female (-1 is male and +1 is female). I visually inspected the data and
found that using a cutoff of > -.47 for male and <.47 seemed to provide me with a conservative estimate of the proportion of males and females. Those employees
whose name was rated with a probability between -.47 and .47 were excluded from any further analyses.

I excluded any universities with fewer than 20 cases in any rank (e.g., 
assistant professor, associate professor, professor) from further analyses.

With the remaining data, I produced pie graphs to represent the proportion of 
female professors across a number of different categories (i.e., school, and 
school by rank).

To figure out whether salary differed by sex and rank, I calculate the mean 
salary of women and men at each rank. I also did this for each university.
Additionally I calculated the standard error of the mean, to give a visual
representation of the variabilty within each sample. I produced graphs of pay
by sex and rank for all cases as well as for each school. In addtion to the
mean by group I also plotted the standard error of the mean.

The R script is used to examine whether the differences are statiscially 
significant. The script runs a two factor ANOVA(Sex, Rank) for each grouping
(all cases, cases in each school). The script also runs independent samples 
t-tests at each rank to determine whether there is a difference between male
and female salaries.
